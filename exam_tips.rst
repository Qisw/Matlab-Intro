Tips for Exams
==============

Slow down
---------

#. Most exam answers are quite short. The trick is to approach the
   question correctly from the start.
#. Algebra errors are quite costly. They can be avoided by slowing down,
   writing carefully, and checking your algebra from time to time.
#. Read the question carefully. I often grade answers that clearly
   overlooked a piece of information that was given in the question.

Don’t panic
-----------

Don’t panic when an answer does not come together. Move on to the next
question and come back to the one that bugs you later.

Explain your answers
--------------------

#. Just giving me a graph and letting me figure out the answer does not
   work.
#. When you draw a graph, explain why you think the curves slope up or
   down, etc. If you make a mistake, at least I can give you partial
   credit.

Writing
-------

#. Make room. A lot of answers are very crowded. Then you find that you
   have to fit something else in and soon you have a mess on the page,
   where I don’t even know in what order I am supposed to read things.
#. If I can’t read it, I can’t grade it.
